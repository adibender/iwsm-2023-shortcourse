## Example: Infant Mortality

- Infants were included in the study when their mother died (left truncation event)
- Two infants of same age whose mother was still alive were matched into the study
- All infants still alive were censored at the end of the study (365 days)
- Infants that die before their mother never enter the study
- Hypothesis: infants whose mothers are still alive survive longer


```{r, echo = TRUE}
data("infants", package = "eha")
head(infants)
xtabs(~event + mother, data = infants)
summary(infants$exit)
infants |>
  group_by(mother) |>
  summarize(mean = mean(exit - enter), median = median(exit - enter))
```


### Kaplan-Meier estimates
#### "Naive"

```{r}
km <- survfit(Surv(exit, event)~ mother, data = infants)
plot(km, las = 1, col = c(1,2), ylab = "S(t)", xlab = "Days")
legend("bottomleft", col = c(1,2), legend = c("mother alive", "mother dead"), lty = 1)
abline(h = 0.5, lty = 2)
```

- no censoring during follow-up, only at the end of study period of 365 days
- so called *administrative* censoring


#### Taking left-truncation into account

```{r}
km <- survfit(Surv(enter, exit, event)~ mother, data = infants)
plot(km, las = 1, col = c(1,2), ylab = "S(t)", xlab = "Days")
legend("bottomleft", col = c(1,2), legend = c("mother alive", "mother dead"), lty = 1)
abline(h = 0.5, lty = 2)
```

### Weibull Model

#### "Naive" analysis: Ignore left-truncation

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
m1 <- flexsurvreg(Surv(exit, event) ~ mother, data = infants, dist = "weibull")
levels(infants$mother)
coef(m1)

# (inverse) acceleration factor
exp(coef(m1)[3])
exp(-coef(m1)[3])
```
$\rightarrow$ Given everything else equal, expected survival time for infants whose mothers are still alive is $\sim `r round(exp(-coef(m1)[3]), 0)`$ times higher compared to infants whose mother died.

```{r}
# mean expected survival time:
newdata = data.frame(mother = factor(c("dead", "alive")))
summary(m1, newdata, type = "mean") |> purrr::map(~.x/365)
```


#### Accounting for left-truncation:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
m2 <- flexsurvreg(
  formula = Surv(enter, exit, event, type = "counting") ~ mother,
  data    = infants,
  dist    = "weibull")
# inverse acceleration factor
cbind(coef = -coef(m2)[3], acf = exp(-coef(m2)[3]))
summary(m2, newdata, type = "mean") |> purrr::map(~ .x / 365)
```


#### Comparison to results from **`eha`** package

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# proportional hazards representation of Weibull model
m3 <- eha::phreg(Surv(exit, event) ~ mother, data = infants)
m4 <- eha::phreg(Surv(enter, exit, event) ~ mother, data = infants)
rbind(
  cbind(coef = coef(m3)[1], HR = exp(coef(m3)[1])),
  cbind(coef = coef(m4)[1], HR = exp(coef(m4)[1]))
)
```

- Coefficient estimates from **`flexsurv`** as hazard ratios

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# extract shape parameter
alpha <- 1/exp(-c(coef(m1)[1], coef(m2)[1]))
# calculate hazard ratio
exp(-alpha * c(coef(m1)[3], coef(m2)[3]))
```


#### Non-proportionality?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
m2a <- flexsurvreg(
  formula = Surv(enter, exit, event, type = "counting") ~ mother,
  anc     = list(shape = ~mother),
  data    = infants,
  dist    = "weibull")
coef(m2)
coef(m2a)
AIC(m2, m2a)
```

#### Further covariates

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
m2b <- flexsurvreg(
  formula = Surv(enter, exit, event, type = "counting") ~ mother + age + sex + parish + civst + ses,
  data    = infants,
  dist    = "weibull")
coef(m2b)
alpha <- 1/exp(-coef(m2b)[1])
exp(-alpha * coef(m2b)[-c(1:2)])
AIC(m2, m2b)
```



### Cox Model

```{r}
m_cph <- coxph(
  formula = Surv(enter, exit, event) ~ mother + age + sex + parish + civst + ses,
  data    = infants)
m_cph_eha <- eha::coxreg(
  formula = Surv(enter, exit, event) ~ mother + age + sex + parish + civst + ses,
  data    = infants)
cbind(
  cph     = exp(coef(m_cph)),
  cph_eha = exp(coef(m_cph_eha)),
  wb      = exp(-alpha * coef(m2b)[-c(1:2)]))
```


### Left-truncation in Event History Analysis

- So far we only considered transitions from the initial status (e.g., alive) to a single event of interest (e.g., death)
- However, methods for Lifetime Data Analysis can also be applied to settings with
multiple states and trasitions between them
- This more general setting is often refered to as *Event History Analysis*


![](../slides/figures/event-history-analysis.png)


- Left-truncation can occur in each of the "0" states (mostly because of study design/inclusion criteria, i.e.)
- In Addition, left truncation is relevant for each (secondary) transition in a Multi-State Model (MSM), e.g.,
  + When estimating the hazard for transition "1 $\rightarrow$ 2", subjects arrive in state "1" at differnt time points
  + Similarly, for transitions "2 $\rightarrow$ 1" and "2 $\rightarrow$ 3"
  + State "3" is a competing risk w.r.t. state "1"
