# A short, incomplete history of PEMs/PAMMs

- **~1980**: Couple of publications, showing equivalence of PEM and Cox Model and how to fit them with standard GLMs `r Citep(bib, c("holford_analysis_1980", "whitehead_fitting_1980", "friedman_piecewise_1982"))`

- **early 2000s**: Mixed Modelling/GAM modelling of PEMs:`r Citep(bib, c("cai_mixed_2002", "kauermann_penalized_2005"))`

- **2015**: `r Citep(bib, c("argyropoulos_analysis_2015"))`: "Analysis of Time to Event Outcomes in Randomized Controlled Trials by Generalized Additive Models" -> specific way of splitting follow-up to reduce number of splits -> `@ChristosArgyrop` at Twitter

- **2018 - today**: some work from ourselves on PEMs/PAMMs, including

  - **`pammtools`** software
  - Tutorial
  - cumulative effects/exposure-lag-response associations
  - competing risks
  - recurrent events
  - ML-/DL-based extensions
